This project aims to develop an objective tool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzcvWdnT0sw">to determine fluid overload in children receiving dialysis</a>.
B-lines, defined as discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic reverberation artefacts in lung ultrasounds, have been shown to correlate with extravascular lung water in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults and children on dialysis. Recent studies have shown this technique to be useful in children on dialysis.

We restored line restoration in speckle images by addressing this as a sparse estimation problem using both convex and
non-convex optimisation techniques based on the Radon transform and sparsity regularisation. This breaks into
subproblems which are solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), thereby achieving
line detection and deconvolution simultaneously. An automatic B-line identification method is then proposed,
using a simple local maxima technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions
of line artefacts.

Figure below shows B-mode ultrasound image and detected lines (top row) and Radon transform domain representation of the restored B-mode images (bottom row). Red, yellow, blue and green lines represent the pleural lines, B-lines, A-lines and Z-lines, respectively

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for B-line detection. 

Usage:

To run GUI: Blinedetection.m

To run as command line: runBlinedetection.m

Note: This code works on the images from a linear probe. The curvelinear image has to be rectified first.
